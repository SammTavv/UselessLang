# UselessLang
Probably the most unappetizing programming language.
<br>Let's start this with a general overview of the *fantastic* features.

## Types
In UselessLang there are a few types that can be typed to uhhh code, i guess.
<br>These include:
- `number`: `int32`
- `longnumber`: `float`
- `word`: `string` (without spaces)
- `longword`: `string` (with spaces)
- `shortword`: `char`
- `question`: `bool`
- `notset`: `null`

### `number` and `longnumber`
`number`s are just normal 32 bit integers.
<br>`longnumber`s are just normal floats.

### `word`, `longword` and `shortword`
`word` is a string that CAN'T contain spaces.
<br>`longword` is a string that CAN contain spaces.
<br>`shortword` is a single character.

### `question`
`question` is a boolean, that means it can have one of these values: `true` or `false`.
<br>If you're unsure of the answer to a `question`, you can set it to `idk`, which randomly returns `true` or `false` every time it's accessed.
