# UselessLang
Probably the most unappetizing programming language.
<br>Let's start this with a general overview of the *fantastic* features.

## Types
In UselessLang there are a few types that can be typed to uhhh code, i guess
<br>These include:
- `number`: `int32`
- `longnumber`: `float`
- `word`: `string` (without spaces)
- `longword`: `string` (with spaces)
- `shortword`: `char`
- `question`: `bool`
